5 Things I learned on Day 3:
1. List comprehensions & Dict comprehensions.
2. Algorithm to find solution to the prime number problem.
3. Always use function if __name__ == "__main__" for any script program.
4. We should think on a problem then write it down and then break it to simplfy it and then try to work on the solution.
5. Before speeding up for the solution THINK and then take actions.
